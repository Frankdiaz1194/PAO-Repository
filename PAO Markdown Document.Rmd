## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r playing}
# GL NAV DOMESTIC INTERCONNECTIVITY MAPS
# FAST FACTS AND TALKING POINTS
# Last Updated: MARCH 12, 2024

# INPUT FILES NEEDED ####

# IN SOURCE FILE LOCATION/ FOLDER
# ... GL Talking Points template spreadsheet
# ... national rankings spreadsheet from WCSC: save as WCSC_tonnagebystate_CY##.xlsx
# ... national cargo and trips spreadsheet (All Regions) from IWR/WCSC: save as Cargo_20##-20## All Regions 10yrs.xlsx

# IMPORTANT: you must save these files using very specific file names, to feed them through this R code

# WHERE TO GET NATIONAL RANKINGS
#  The national rankings spreadsheet is generated by WCSC every year, and is accessible through:
# ... WCSC Website > Commerce Data > Ports and States Data (Available in Excel format here) > 
# ... select relevant calendar year
# ... Object title: Waterborne Commerce Statistics Center: CY 20## waterborne tonnage by state
# ... Download xlsx file, SAVE WITH THIS NAMING CONVENTION -- WCSC_tonnagebystate_CY##.xlsx
# ... Several tabs, e.g., Port_by_Tons
# ... Columns: RANK, PORT_NAME

# WHERE TO GET CARGO AND TRIPS DATA
#  This is a very large file with several 100,000s of rows of data.
# ... WCSC Website > Commerce Data > Waterborne Cargo and Trips Data Files > 
# ... Select link with naming convention: Cargo_20##-20## All Regions 10yrs
# ... download xlsx file and use same naming convention
# ... Columns: Waterway, WaterwayName, TrafficCode, TrafficName, Commodity, etc.

# RECENT UPDATES TO CODE ####

# FY23
# ... FY22 talking points and fast facts highlighted shipment/receipt/thru/intraport data for ONE CY YEAR ONLY.
# ... FY23 talking points and fast facts highlight shipment/receipt/thru/intraport data for 5 YEAR AVERAGE.
# ... minor changes: FY23 file naming convention and set working directory

# FY24
# ... FY24  a looooooot of stuff

# UPDATE MANUALLY ####

# Set the project directory. Note: Inputs folder contains all raw data needed to run this code "Inputs/..."
setwd("C:/Users/h5pmldfb/OneDrive - US Army Corps of Engineers/PAO Project")

# Manually update FY every year
FY <- 2023

# Manually exclude ports for later calculate_ranking Function (Filter by )
Excluded_ports <- c(3001, 3101, 3191, 3201, 3230, 3301, 3401, 3501, 3601, 3701, 3802, 3810, 3811, 3850, 3901, 3999)

# MAIN BODY OF CODE ####
# Calculate calendar year based on fiscal year
calendar_year <- FY - 2

# Calculate short version of fiscal year (e.g., FY23)
FY_short <- FY - 2000

# Calculate short version of calendar year (e.g., 23)
calendar_short <- calendar_year - 2000

# Load necessary libraries. Install packages if not done yet 'install.packages("my_package")'
library(readxl)
library(openxlsx)
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
library(writexl)
library(purrr)

# Function to read tonnage and direction data for all ports nationally. File "Cargo2012-2021 All Regions"
read_tonnage_data <- function(calendar_year) {
  # Construct the file path based on the calendar year
  file_path <- paste0("Inputs/Cargo", calendar_year - 9, "-", calendar_year, " All Regions.xlsx")
  # Check if the file exists
  if (file.exists(file_path)) {
    # Read the Excel file
    data <- read_xlsx(file_path)
    return(data)  # Return the data frame
  } else {
    stop("File not found:", file_path)  # Throw an error if the file is not found
  }
}
#Store the result in the 'data' dataset/frame by calling the above function.
data <- read_tonnage_data(calendar_year)
View(data)
```

## Including Plots

# can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
#plot(pressure)
```

#Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
